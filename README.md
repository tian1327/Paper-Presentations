# Paper_Presentations

Presentations made with my understanding on some interesting papers covering Machine Learning, Edge Computing, Irrigation Optimization etc. 

Free to use, but please cite me. ;)

#### Deep Learning Algorithms:
1. [Hyperband]() ([JMLR 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560)): address the trade-off between numer of configurations to search vs. resources assigned to each config




#### ML/DL with Edge Comuting
1. [DeepCOD]() ([SenSys 2020 Best Paper](https://yscacaca.github.io/publication/yao-2020-deepcod/yao-2020-deepcod.pdf)): deep compress offloading frame work combining compressive sensing theory and generative neural networks, significantly reduce inference latency while maintaining high accuracy

2. [Hermes]() ([MobiCom2021]()): efficient Federated Learning Framework with pruning weights


#### Irrigation Optimization
1. [WISDOM]() ([Paper](SenSys 2019)): optimizing irrigation scheduling at large scale with mositure sensors and data-driven models


#### Rain Sensing
1.
