## Paper_Presentations

Presentations made with my understanding on some interesting papers covering Machine Learning, Edge Computing, Irrigation Optimization etc. 

Free to use, but please cite me. ;)

### Deep Learning Algorithms:
1. [Hyperband]() ([JMLR 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560)): address the trade-off between numer of configurations to search vs. resources assigned to each config




### ML/DL with Edge Comuting
1. [DeepCOD]() ([SenSys 2020 Best Paper](https://yscacaca.github.io/publication/yao-2020-deepcod/yao-2020-deepcod.pdf)): deep compress offloading frame work combining compressive sensing theory and generative neural networks, significantly reduce inference latency while maintaining high accuracy

2. [Hermes]() ([MobiCom2021]()): efficient Federated Learning Framework with pruning weights

3. [DDS]() ([Sigcomm20](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/docs/DDS-Sigcomm20.pdf)): efficient video streaming using server-driven solutions


### Irrigation Optimization
1. [WISDOM]() ([SenSys 2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3356250.3360023)): optimizing irrigation scheduling at large scale with mositure sensors and data-driven models
